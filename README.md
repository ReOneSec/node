# Nodepay Ultimate

This Python Bot script manages WebSocket connections by generating specified HTTP proxies, Unlimited Proxies and multiple Nodepay Accounts handling authentication and maintaining persistent connections with a server. The script also includes functionality to periodically send ping messages to keep the connection alive forever. If you can run your pc 24/7 then you dont need a Vps or proxy server lol.

## Features

Got it! Hereâ€™s the updated description with copyable dots:

- **Proxy Generation**: Automatically generates proxies for the script.
- **Account Management**: Handles multiple accounts seamlessly.
- **Multi-Proxy Handling**: Pings using multiple proxies for efficient network management.
- **Fast Processing**: Ensures quick and efficient execution of tasks.
